# Privacy Guarantees

In the [Introduction](/), we mentioned three classes of problems that arise in
current decentralized exchanges: Lack of pre-trade privacy, lack of post-trade
privacy, and MEV. By using pairwise MPC matching and zero-knowledge settlement
as discussed in [The MPC-ZKP Architecture](/core-concepts/mpc-zkp), Renegade
solves all three of these problems:

- **Pre-trade privacy**. Since wallets are maintained locally by relayers, the
  smart contract never sees any order or balance information. Also, handshakes
  are propagated with _commitments_ to the orders (rather than the plaintext
  orders themselves), so no information is learned about an order in advance of
  it matching.
- **Post-trade privacy**. The on-chain state only consists of a Merkle tree of
  _commitments_ to wallets, so balances, orders, and trades are never posted
  in-the-clear, even after a valid match. Even the counterparty only learns
  what tokens were swapped; they cannot learn, for example, the full size
  behind a match.
- **Minimal MEV**. Since the smart contract only checks zero-knowledge proofs,
  the block producer or sequencer has no ability whatsoever to sandwich or
  front-run trades.

Put differently, Renegade claims the following privacy properties:

- **Third-parties** to a trade (including the sequencer/proposer) learn nothing
  about the state of the exchange, aside from global token in-flows and
  out-flows and the total number of open orders.
- **Counterparties** to your trade learn what tokens were swapped if there was
  a match, but nothing else. If there was no match, then counterparties only
  learn this fact.
- **Relayer(s)** who manage a wallet learn the contents of the wallet
  (balances, outstanding orders, etc.), but have no ability to mutate the
  wallet.
